## Project Name: Your Technical Advisor


#### Idea:
The idea, quite simply, is a website or a system that provides a service to anyone who uses technology in its various forms, and this service is either by consulting technology specialists or by providing technical service through technicians or specialists.
This site or system is considered a link between the customer and the service provider, whether a specialist or a technician.

#### Inspiration:
In this era of time, I think expect that most or everyone from my personal perspective is a user of technology, either directly or indirectly.
From this point of view, I was inspired by this idea, I noticed the many questions and the lack of knowledge in technical matters from its users, and how to use them correctly and safely, and the scarcity of those who provide this service with the simplest and fastest solutions and at a price that suits all groups.
